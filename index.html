        <h1>Folk Songs of Olde Englande</h1>
        <p>England thankfully enjoys a rich heritage of music and musicians, so it is good to pay homage to our national musical history. The term 'Folk music' may abbreviate simply to 'Folk'.</p>
        <p>English Folk takes us back at least to the Seventeenth Century, if not even earlier. Like the heritage of any nation, their stories speak of the culture, social norms and spoken language of their day. In listening to the songs, we can learn of their lives.</p>
        <p>They tell us of their work, their relationships, their tribulations, beliefs, pleasure and suffering.</p>
        <p>These commonfolk musicians of days gone share with us a catchy vibe and a natural and grounded tone. For many, the tradition feels as though it can bring us back in touch with nature.</p>
        <p>Traditional Folk wouldn't have been notated, or at least not much evidence survives!  Rather, the musical skill and learning were transmitted orally between the generations. For instance, ordinary people would have played instruments between themselves and practised their singing on a regular basis, even for a few hundred years.</p>
        <p>Folk music, interestingly, thrives in England to this day, both as authentic English Folk artists and bands or loosely influencing other musical styles.</p><br>
